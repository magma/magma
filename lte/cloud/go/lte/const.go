	File const.go provides constants used across the LTE module.

	A number of the constants refer to configurator network entities. These
	are reproduced and annotated below.
	Note: starred Swagger models also have mutable versions of the model.

	            '-> base_name -> policy*
	*policy -> policy_qos_profile

	Notes

	Where possible, keep cellular_gateway and subscriber as sources rather
	than sinks. This reduces the number of data migrations required to
	reorganize the graph into a set of acyclic relations.
