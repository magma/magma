/* Package ha provides the LTE HA orc8r service.

This service has a single RPC endpoint. The RPC endpoint will be used by
secondary gateways' MME to know when to offload its users for a given ENB
back to the primary.

To gather this state, this service looks at the primary gateways in the
gateway pool(s) of the calling gateway. For each primary it fetches the
configured ENBs and then checks the following state:

1. Has the primary checked in within last 3 mins
2. Is the ENB connected to the primary within last 3 mins
3. Does the ENB have throughput on the primary

The service then sends back the ENB ID -> offload state
for all of these.
