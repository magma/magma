# Magma Rewards Program

## Summary

The Magma rewards program is intended to attract new contributors, make them familiar with the project and enable monetary gain for specific contributions.

## How The Rewards Program Works

### Eligibilty

The Magma rewards program uses Github sponsorships for payment. To receive a reward you must have an active Github sponsorship account.

### Reward Eligible Github Issues

Github issues eligible for a reward can be found in the table at the end of this document. All issues are assigned a level of complexity corresponding to the potential reward. All reward eligible issues and their complexity must be approved by a recorded TSC vote.

Note, reward amounts are exclusive of any fees imposed by Github or Stripe. The final reward amount received can vary depending on fees.

### Claim a Reward

To claim a reward you must file a PR that resolves a reward eligible issue. The TSC will review the PR and make a determination via a weighted vote. Please note, filing a PR does not guarantee a reward and all TSC decisions are final. In the case of multiple folks submitting PRs, they will be evaluated in the order in which they were filed (oldest first).

### Weighted Voting

The leader of the working group who proposed the reward eligible issue has a weight of 2 votes for approval/rejection of the PR while remaining TSC members will have only 1 vote.

### Receiving A Reward

Once approved, rewards are paid via a Github sponsorship one-time payment.
