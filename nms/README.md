# Magma Network Management System - Development
The Magma NMS provides an enterprise grade GUI for provisioning and operating magma based networks.

> NOTE:
>
> This document is written to help with development of the Magma NMS
>
> See the [**docs**](https://docs.magmacore.org/docs/next/nms/overview) for a user-focused guide.

## Project Layout

The NMS application lives in [`nms/`](../nms/).
Here, `package.json` specifies the necessary dependencies and development scripts.
Triggering unit tests, e2e tests, eslint, and flow tests is done from this directory.

---
## Running Local Dev NMS
> NOTE: This guide is written for development directly using Docker.
> You may need to make adjustments if using MiniKube.

### Pre-requisites
**Docker Settings**
- Ensure you have Docker installed
- Configure Docker to at least 4 GiB allocated memory for Orc8r + NMS

**Magma Orc8r**
- The NMS requires a working connection to the Magma Orc8r to function.
- For local development, bring up the Orc8r docker containers.
- See `magma/orc8r/cloud/docker/docker-compose.yml`

**NMS Metrics and Graphing**
- To ensure that NMS has access to metrics and graphing functionality, bring up the Prometheus and Grafana containers.
- See `magma/orc8r/cloud/docker/docker-compose.metrics.yml`
- This is optional during development

### Build NMS Docker Image
Run the following command from [`nms/`](../nms/)
```
COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME=magmalte docker-compose build magmalte
```

### Run NMS Containers
Run the following command from [`nms/`](../nms/)
```
docker-compose up -d
```

## NMS Troubleshooting

### First Time Running NMS
We recommend that the first time you bring up the Magma NMS,
you do so without any local changes,
allowing you to troubleshoot your setup.
This should correspond to a recent pull of the `main`/`master` branch from Github.

Here are some example logs from the Magma NMS `magmalte` container from a successful startup:
```
âžœ  magmalte git:(1-9-nms-orgs-fix) docker-compose logs -f magmalte

```

### Checking NMS Logs
Run the following from [`nms/`](../nms/)
```
docker-compose logs -f magmalte
```

Depending on the issues you run into, you may need to check the logs of other containers, both NMS and Orc8r related.

If the NMS application server crashes, you will likely find the following error log:
```
[nodemon] app crashed - waiting for file changes before starting...
```

### Cannot Connect to NMS Through Browser
If your NMS containers are up and running, it is likely that the NMS app server has crashed.
Check the `magmalte` container logs.

### NMS Loads a Blank Page
This likely corresponds to React errors.
If this is the case, you should be able to see the relevant error logs through your web browser's developer tools.

## Testing

### Install Dependencies
Running eslint and flow tests requires installing dependencies.

Install node and npm if you haven't already

Install yarn if you don't already have it:
```
npm install --global yarn
```

Run the following command from [`nms/`](../nms/) to install all dependencies:
```
yarn install --frozen-lockfile
```

### Eslint
Run from [`nms/`](../nms/).
Version `7.3.2` of `eslint` is used currently.
```
yarn run eslint ./
```

### Flow
Run from [`nms/`](../nms/).
Version `0.132.0` of `flow` is used currently.
```
flow
```

### Unit Tests
Run from [`nms/`](../nms/)
```
yarn run test
```

### E2E Tests
Run from [`nms/`](../nms/)
```
./e2e_test_setup.sh
```
This brings up the NMS docker containers, as well as a mock Orc8r API server.
Tests are run using puppeteer to control a headless Chrome.

These tests can also be triggered without the mocked API.
Run the following in [`nms/`](../nms/) in the `magmalte` docker container:
```
yarn test:e2e
```

### Testing Coverage

Run `yarn test --coverage`

## Updating NMS for API Changes

### How to re-generate MagmaAPIBindings.js
Run `./build.py --generate` in `${MAGMA_ROOT}/orc8r/cloud/docker`

This re-generates various files, including `MagmaAPIBindings.js` for NMS.

### How to re-generate MagmaAPIBindings.js (old)
1. Place an up-to-date `swagger.yml` in [`nms/`](../nms/)
   You can get the full `swagger.yml` at `{orc8r domain}/swagger/v1/spec`
   (e.g. `https://localhost:9443/swagger/v1/spec`)
2. Run `scripts/generateAPIFromSwagger.sh` from [`nms/`](../nms/)
3. Delete `swagger.yml` afterwards

## Accessing Local Dev NMS

### Multitenancy and Organizations

Multitenancy is supported in the Magma NMS. Each tenant is called an "organization".
Each organization owns a subset of the networks provisioned on Orchestrator, and the special `host` organization administrates organizations in the system.

Users in organizations log into the NMS using a subdomain that matches their organization name.
For example, users of a *NewOrg* organization in the NMS would access the NMS using http://<NEWORG>.localhost:8081/nms

Note that any NMS user can only access the organization it was created under.

### First-time Setup
When you deploy the NMS for the first time, you'll need to create a user that has access to the host organization.

Run the following command from [`nms/`](../nms/) and make sure to substitute `ADMIN_USER_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD` with your desired email and password.
```
docker-compose exec magmalte yarn setAdminPassword host ADMIN_USER_EMAIL ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD
```

Access the `host` (http://host.localhost:8081/host) portal to create your first organization.
Create a new super user for that organization, and then you can login as that user for your new organization.

For example, if you created an organization called `magma-test`, you can access the NMS at http://magma-test.localhost:8081/nms

### First-time Setup (Fast)

Run the following from [`nms/`](../nms/) to create two users, one for `host` organization, and another for `magma-test`.
The username and password for both will be `admin@magma.test` and `password1234`
```
./scripts/dev_setup.sh
```

### Host Portal
The host portal allows management of organizations.

http://host.localhost:8081/host

### Admin Portal
The admin portal allows management for users of an organization.

For a `magma-test` organization, you would access the admin portal at the following:
http://magma-test.localhost:8081/admin

### NMS Portal
Regular users will do their regular network management through the NMS portal.

For a `magma-test` organization, you would access the NMS at the following:
http://magma-test.localhost:8081/nms
