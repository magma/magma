# fbc-js-core

Originally a collection of JS packages used by different FBC projects ([Magma](https://github.com/magma/magma), Symphony and more).

Now, there are copies of the original `fbc-js-core`, now sitting in the Magma repository, and the Terragraph repository.

The original source for distribution as JS packages is available in the now-archived [`fbc-js-core` repo](https://github.com/magma/fbc-js-core).
