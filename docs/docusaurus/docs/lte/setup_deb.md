# Access Gateway Setup (On Bare Metal)
## Prerequisites

To setup a Magma Access Gateway, you will need a machine that
satisfies the following requirements:


- Docker host where the container AGW_DEPLOY will be built. This container can
  be run directly on your machine or a remote host, as long as it can reach
  your Access Gateway. The `agw_prepare.sh` script will assign the static IP
  address 10.0.2.1 to the `eth1` interface, so on your host, assign the
  interface that you are using to connect to the AGW the IP address `10.0.2.2`
  with netmask `255.255.255.0`, and set the priority of this interface to
  maximum.

- AGW_HOST: 64bit-X86 machine, hardware strongly recommended (not virtualized).
  You will need two ethernet ports. We use enp1s0 and enp2s0 in this guide.
  They might have different names on your hardware so just replace enp1s0 and
  enp2s0 with your current interfaces name in this guideline.
  One port is for the SGi interface (default: enp1s0) and one for the S1
  interface (default: enp2s0). Note that the `agw_prepare.sh` script will
  rename the `enp1s0` interface to `eth0`.

## Deployment
### 1. Create boot USB stick and install Debian on your AGW host

- Download .iso image from [Debian mirror](https://cdimage.debian.org/cdimage/archive/9.13.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-9.13.0-amd64-netinst.iso)
- Create bootable usb using etcher [tutorial here](https://tutorials.ubuntu.com/tutorial/tutorial-create-a-usb-stick-on-macos#0)
- Boot your AGW host from USB
  (Press F11 to select boot sequence, :warning: This might be different for
  your machine). If you see 2 options to boot from USB, select the non-UEFI
  option.
- Install and configure you access gateway according to your network defaults.
    - Make sure to enable ssh server and utilities (untick every other)
- Connect your SGi interface to the internet and select this port during the
installation process to get an IP using DHCP.

### 2. Prepare AGW_HOST
- [AGW_HOST] Prepare AGW_HOST

```bash
su
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/magma/magma/v1.0.0/lte/gateway/deploy/agw_prepare.sh
sh agw_prepare.sh
```

A prompt will pop up to as you if you want to stop removing linux-image-4.9.0-11-amd64 please hit: No

### 3. Prepare AGW_DEPLOY
- [AGW_DEPLOY] Build and run AGW_DEPLOY container

```bash
git clone https://github.com/magma/magma.git ~/magma
git fetch && git fetch --tags
git checkout v1.0.0

cd ~/magma
docker build --build-arg CACHE_DATE="$(date)" -t agw_deploy -f lte/gateway/docker/deploy/Dockerfile .
docker run -it agw_deploy bash
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub magma@10.0.2.1:/home/magma/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

### 4. Build openvswitch on Access Gateway
- [AGW_DEPLOY] Run build playbook

``` bash
cd ~/magma/lte/gateway/deploy
ansible-playbook -e "MAGMA_ROOT='~/magma' OUTPUT_DIR='/tmp'" -i agw_hosts ovs_build.yml
```

### 5. Deploy Access Gateway
- [AGW_DEPLOY] Run deploy playbook

``` bash
cd ~/magma/lte/gateway/deploy
ansible-playbook -i agw_hosts -e "PACKAGE_LOCATION='/tmp'" ovs_deploy.yml
```
