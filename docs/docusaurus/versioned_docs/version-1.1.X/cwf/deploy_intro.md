# Deploying Carrier Wifi Gateway: Introduction

These pages will walk through the full process of deploying a
Carrier Wifi Gateway, from building the various containers that you'll need
to installing them on either a Bare-Metal or VM host. This installation guide
targets *production* environments - if you aren't ready for this, the developer
documentation will be up shortly.

If you want to get a head start on the development setup, you can build the
CWF containers following this guide and use docker-compose at
`magma/cwf/gateway/docker` to spin up the local version of the CWF.
