Users can be configured as either a superuser/user/readonly user.
Super User will have capability to view all the metrics in the organization through Grafana.
User will have the capability to view only the metrics for assigned network in the organization.
Read Only user can only view the various components in NMS. They cannot make any edits to the underlying configuration.

## Audit Logs

All configuration change made through NMS can be viewed through the audit log component. Audit log component comes with a convenient interface to search, sort and view the entire JSON payload of the configuration change.
