# Abstract

This document provides the requirements and architectural design details for creating a
vendor neutral Citizens Broadband Radio Service Device (CBSD) Domain Proxy (DP).

A Domain Proxy provides proxy and aggregation services
for signaling between CBSD radios (eNBs or CPEs)
and a Spectrum Access System (SAS).

# Background

The interface between SAS and CBSD/DP is a standardized interface.

The interface between a DP and the CBSD is not standardized and can be based on
multiple protocols including the WInnForum defined SAS to
CBSD/DP REST API, TR-069, SNMP, or NETCONF.

This solution will include support for DP to CBSD interface based on the standard
WInnForum SAS to CBSD/DP signaling protocol.

Support for additional DP to CBSD interface protocols is not in scope
but the design should take into consideration the ability to easily extend DP
functionality with in a plugin-based manner.

## Vendor Neutral Domain Proxy HLD

The vendor neutral DP will run as kubernetes managed containers
in a microservice architecture.
The deployment of the vendor neutral DP can be in any generic kubernetes
environment such as an on premise compute node (or set of nodes) or in a
cloud environment such as AWS.

# Rationale

A vendor neutral Domain Proxy provides a number of benefits to a CBRS
deployment:

-   The aggregation and proxy function allows for a single connection
    between a customer network of CBSDs and the SAS. This provides a
    small attack surface by reducing the number of outbound connections
    traversing the customer firewall and edge devices.

-   A domain proxy can be deployed in a controlled stable environment
    allowing it to provide a consistent interface to the SAS on behalf
    of a CBSD which may be subject to intermittent loss of power or
    connectivity.

-   It provides a point of coordination/control for radio channel
    allocation in a multi-vendor deployment.

-   It allows for the application of additional grant requesting and
    maintenance logic which can correct errant behavior and/or provide
    an optimization layer over vendor SAS client algorithms.


# Compatibility

Domain Proxy solution will reuse as much of the Magma services as possible.

It should be easily deployed within existing Magma environment.

As DP will be implementing radio interfaces, the intention is to follow
and comply with the Magma Community guidelines and codebase where applicable.

# Observability and Debug

The plan is to follow Magma best practices regarding application observability
(logging, telemetry, debugging applications and the DP state)
as well as utilize already existing tools and solutions in Magma infrastructure.

Applications should produce logs with a capability to ingest that data
into monitoring systems (like ElasticSearch).

Applications will gather and expose various telemetry data,
like number or requests received,
number or request failures,
generic application resource use (CPU, RAM, etc.)

# Implementation

## DP Microservices

Domain Proxy will consist of a number of components in a microservice architecture.

* **API Gateway**
  
  API Gateway will act as a central API router of the Domain Proxy.
  It will be responsible for receiving incoming CBSD requests
  and routing them to the appropriate Protocol Controllers
  based on the protocol.

* **Protocol Controller (PC)**

  Protocol Controller is responsible for receiving the initial traffic
  from individual CBSDs (radios), translating the requests
  into a common API protocol and forwarding them to the Radio Controller.

  One PC will implement support for one interface from CBSD side.

  Initially this means only Domain Proxy protocol, but the idea behind
  Protocol Controllers is for them to be written in such a manner that
  having one of them in place, it should be straightforward to add
  another one (it can be achieved by having a ProtocolController abstract class
  to provide structure for particular PC implementations).

  To scale the system better we are decoupling PC (responsible for protocol)
  from Radio controller (responsible for the business domain).
  Additional benefit is maintaining all of the protocol customizations
  and tricks at the PC level and making the PC layer scalable
  according to the number of eNBs of each type.

* **Radio Controller (RC)**

  RC is responsible for receiving the requests from
  and sending responses to  PCs.
  It manages all request data and state within the Database.

* **Configuration controller (CC)**

  CC is used process requests and communicate with the SAS server
  using SAS protocol.
  This component issues a request to SAS and updates the request state
  after receiving a reply within the Database.

* **Database**

  Relational DB storing the state CBSD requests and responses.

  DB allows to keep track of grants and CBSDs configuration limiting redundant CBSD - SAS connections.

## Component Interactions

* **API Gateway**
  API gateway will receive incoming requests from CBSDs.
  Depending on the incoming protocol it will route the traffic to appropriate
  k8s protocol controller handling that protocol via a k8s service (which will act as a load balancer).

* **Protocol Controller**

  PC will pass the requests it receives from CBSDs to the RC over gRPC.

  PC will check for the request response with RC via gRPC
  and send the response back to CBSD.

* **Radio Controller**

  RC receives requests from the PC over HTTPs and puts them in
  the DB.

  RC accepts incoming request response check requests from PC.

* **Configuration Controller**

  CC fetches pending requests from the DB, batches them and sends them to SAS.

  After receiving the response from SAS, it updates the DB state
  for the requests processed.

* **Database**

  Handles DB queries coming from RC and CC.

## Solution scaling

The Domain Proxy will be split into separate services in separate containers.

Every service will work in HA mode to provide service even in failover scenarios.

All DP components will be stateless Python based services
which do not need synchronization between them
so it is not vital to create sync mechanisms.
Applications will take over processing of data
when one of the containers fail.

Because the DP applications/containers are stateless,
a horizontal scaling would be possible if there is a need to improve
DP application performance.
For instance, if there is a very big number or CBSD devices,
it would be possible to have multiple PC container instances,
each sharing a portion of the CBSD traffic.
Similarly, if there is a big number or requests that need to be processed, multiple RCs could be deployed to share the PC load.

## Batching of messages

Batching of messages allows to limit the number of connections to the SAS servers
which is useful in the case when a number of CBSDs send requests at once
(e.g. heartbeat requests are sent continuously).
Batching it limits a chance of failure on sending requests to the SAS,
because SAS has to process only a minimum number of requests
instead of numerous requests sent one by one.
In large infrastructures it may reduce the cost of SAS usage
and limit the chance of running out of requests per given time
(for Google SAS server it is 50,000 requests per day and 10 queries per second).

Keeping the state is not necessary on the early stage of the project
when Domain Proxy supports only Passive Mode
where requests only pass through the DP.
However, on Active Mode it is necessary to keep the CBSDs objects in the database
as components such as UI monitor registered CBSDs in the Domain Proxy
and allow to edit attributes of the CBSDs.
Using stateless solutions would require to send requests to the SAS server
or CBSDs itself which is not a good design
considering that it may generate additional costs and add additional traffic
between Domain Proxy and other components.
Active Mode with state in the database allows to add additional attributes
not recognized by SAS or CBSD, but useful for the Domain Proxy usage
(labels or additional descriptions for UI purposes such as sorting by groups of CBSDs).

## Architectural Discussion

### Relational database

Since there is a planned UI and additionally we need to store basic,
well defined information about CBSD we suggest to reuse an already existing MySQL / PostgreSQL database
from the Magma Orchestrator component (with a new schema).
At the very beginning the database usage would be limited to:
* storing records for CBSDs (registration parameters, SAS `cbsd_id`, name, configuration, name, location, etc.)
* storing grants
* storing all incoming CBSD requests and SAS responses
* user administration & access rights within DP system

We do not intend to use the Database to store the state changes.
This information will be logged with a possibility to expose it
to external monitoring systems (like ElasticSearch) for observability
and debugging purposes.

Because the use of a relational DB is necessary to fulfill the DP requirements,
this fact was one of the incentives to use the DB as a data exchange point
for the DP components, acting both as a persistent DP state
and data buffer/queue.

### Queuing mechanisms

One of the goals of the Domain Proxy is to provide a stable exchange
of information between CBSDs and SAS and minimize the network traffic
between them.
In the initial concept of the design, we took into consideration popular
existing queuing mechanisms which would gives us natural batching functionality
while the DB would only serve as a persistent state store.

There are many benefits where workload dispatching realized over a queue would give
(out-of-the-box batching, acknowledgement, retry, persistence, speed).
While those concepts could also be modeled within a relational DB,
the logic behind it would require application development support
and an increased transactional traffic to the DB.

### Message Queue Pros/Cons

* **RabbitMQ**
  * Pros:
    - Out-of-the-box fulfills our requirement for batching requests
    - Microservice approach: easier to split into components, mock & test
    - Event-based flow is a reasonable way when there can be multiple consumers
    - Utilizing a full-blown queue makes the architecture extendable - we don’t need to incorporate a pub/sub solution in each new subscribing component
    - The component is purely internal - it won’t affect other architecture components built by the community

  * Cons:
    - Additional infrastructure component to maintain (internal to th DP)
    - Pub/Sub overhead (minor in our scenario)

* **ZeroMQ**
  * Pros:
    - ZeroMQ implements queuing at a higher abstraction level - no need to deal with networking, sockets, etc.
    - Component is already used in the ecosystem

  * Cons:
    - It’s a very simple queue, the required functionalities like message batching, persistency, still would need to be implemented and later maintained as separate components (potentially bug-prone)
    - It would need to be separately added to each component which would need queuing functionalities
    - Cannot be easily replaced, mocked, up- or downscaled basing on the needs

Based on the Magma Community discussion and feedback, the additional cost
of development and DB transaction load is negligible. As a result, DP will
fully realize the DB for state persistence and data exchange, "queueing"
and batching.

## Resource requirements and estimates

All requirements and estimates here are a subject to change as development
progresses.

Assuming DP will handle 10000 CBSDs,
we estimate the following total system requirements for each DP service
(if there is horizontal scaling,
those requirements are divided among the number of containers):

* **API Gateway**
  8 CPUs, 8GB RAM

* **Protocol Controller**
  16 CPUs, 16GB RAM

* **Radio Controller**
  16 CPUs, 16GB RAM

* **Configuration Controller**
  4 CPUs, 8GB RAM

Assuming DP will handle 10000 CBSD devices simultaneously, with 1 min heartbeat interval
we estimate the following Database traffic:

* DB `select` - up to 20000 select queries per minute (check request states and responses, request polling) 
* DB `insert` - up to 70000 insert queries per minute (each request, each response, cbsd and grant)
* DB `update` - up to 35000 update queries per minute (update request state, update grant state, update cbsd state)

## System Architecture

Based on the analysis and Community discussions, the resulting architecture
of the DP is as follows:

Assuming the architecture, and example data flow for a Registration Request is as follows:

# Q/A Feedback

Q: Can we run on VMware

A: To make it more future proof, we should build it on k8s (not VMs);
but vSphere should have the ability to deploy and manage k8s. so it can
be VMware k8s

Q: High availability: will these be active-active or active-standby?

A: The app itself running on k8s will be active-active. k8s controller
will provide for HA by managing the individual DP application
containers; with k8s managed HA is active-active.

Q: multi-vendor SAS capabilities

A: Yes, the plan is for multi-vendor SAS support. We have UI-2 in place
to allow for selection of a default. UI-3 requirement has been edited to
more specifically allow for batch override of SAS vendor for a selected
set of CBSDs e.g. a vendor group, or all radios at a site.

Q: Audit trail abilities

A: Full audit details will be displayable and exportable including all
configuration changes and SAS and eNB message logging.

Q: Easy eNB location mapping

A: All CBSD data the DP has will be exportable and we can have a
selection pane to allow selection of attributes to export e.g. if you
just want name and lat/long.

Q: What are Active/Passive modes:

A: The idea is to start with a simple Passive mode where there is no
message mangling or internal logic applied as messages are proxied from
the CBSD interface to the SAS interface. However, we want the
architecture to plan for and allow the insertion of logic modules in the
future that sit between the CBSD and SAS interface to allow for more
than a simply proxy. The motivation here is it allows for a DP to mask
undesirable behavior in CBSDs and/or optimize a multi-vendor deployment
by separately controlling SAS and CBSD messaging per CBSD.
