# Configure eNodeB

## Prerequisites

Make sure you follow the instructions in "[Deploying Orchestrator](../orc8r/deploy_intro.md)" for successful
installation of Orchestrator and the instructions in "[AGW Configuration](deploy_config_agw.md)" to provision and
configure your Access Gateway (AGW).

## S1 interface

Connect your eNodeB to the `eth1` interface of Magma gateway. Magma uses `eth1`
as the default `S1` interface. If you have more than one eNodeB, use an L2
switch to connect all `S1` interfaces. For debugging purposes, you may find it
particularly useful to do the following:

1. Configure a managed L2 switch (e.g. [this NETGEAR](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-GS108T-200NAS-GS108Tv2-Lifetime-Protection/dp/B07PS6Z162/))
to mirror port X and port Y to port Z.
2. Connect port X of that switch to the `eth1` interface on your AGW.
3. Connect the WAN interface on your enodeB to port Y on the switch.
4. Connect your host to port Z on the switch.

This will allow you to do live packet captures with Wireshark from your host to
debug the S1 interface between the enodeB and the AGW (filter for SCTP).

## Automatic configuration

*Magma officially supports auto-configuration of the following devices:*

- Baicells Nova-243 Outdoor FDD/TDD eNodeB
    - Firmware Version: BaiBS_RTS_3.1.6
    - Firmware Version: BaiBS_RTSH_2.6.0.1
- Baicells mBS1100 LTE-TDD Base Station
    - Firmware Version: BaiStation_V100R001C00B110SPC003
- Baicells Neutrino-244 ID FDD/TDD enodeB

*Magma supports the following management protocols:*

- TR-069 (CWMP)

*Magma supports configuration of the following data models:*

- TR-196 data model
- TR-181 data model

The Magma team plans to add support for more devices and management protocols.

To handle automatic configuration of eNodeB devices on your network, Magma
uses the `enodebd` service. The `enodebd` service is responsible for handling
the O&M interface between Magma and any connected eNodeB. The `enodebd` service
can be disabled if you configure your eNodeB devices manually.

### Baicells

Use the enodeB's management interface to set the management server URL to
`baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080`. Magma uses DNS hijacking to point the eNodeB to
the configuration server being run by enodebd. `baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080`
will point to `192.88.99.142`, the IP address that the TR-069 ACS is
being hosted on.

## Provisioning Your eNodeB on NMS

Get the serial number of your eNodeB, you'll need it to register the device.
On the NMS, navigate to "Equipment" in the sidebar, select "eNodeB" in the
upper left, and hit "Add New" in the upper right.

Configure the RAN parameters in the resulting multi-step modal as necessary.
Note that fields left blank will be inherited from either the network or
gateway LTE parameters:

Then, go back to the "Gateways" page and click on the ID of the AGW that you
registered in the gateway table. Click through to the "Config" tab of the
AGW detail view, then hit "Edit" by the RAN configuration. Select the eNodeB
that you just registered in the multi-select dropdown, then save the update.
Make sure that transmit is enabled.

### Basic Troubleshooting

After connecting your eNodeB(s) to the gateway through the `eth1` interface, you
may want to check a few things if auto-configuration is not working.

Magma will be running a DHCP server to assign an IP address to your connected
eNodeB. Check if an IP address gets assigned to your eNodeB by either checking
the eNodeB UI or monitoring the `dnsd` service.

```bash
journalctl -u magma@dnsd -f

# Check for a similar log
# DHCPDISCOVER(eth1) 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPOFFER(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPREQUEST(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPACK(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
```

Use the `enodebd_cli.py` tool to check basic status of eNodeB(s). It also allows
for querying the value of parameters, setting them, and sending reboot requests
to the eNodeB. The following example gets the status of all connected eNodeBs.

```bash
enodebd_cli.py get_all_status

# --- eNodeB Serial: 120200002618AGP0001 ---
# IP Address..................10.0.2.246
# eNodeB connected.....................1
# eNodeB Configured....................1
# Opstate Enabled......................1
# RF TX on.............................1
# RF TX desired........................1
# GPS Connected........................0
# PTP Connected........................0
# MME Connected........................1
# GPS Longitude...............113.902069
# GPS Latitude.................22.932018
# FSM State...............Completed provisioning eNB. Awaiting new Inform.
```

It may take time for the eNodeB to start transmitting because `enodebd` will
reboot the eNodeB to apply new configurations. Monitor the progress of `enodebd`
using the following command

```bash
journalctl -u magma@enodebd -f

# Check for a similar log
# INFO:root:Successfully configured CPE parameters!
```

## Manual configuration

Manual configuration of connected eNodeB(s) is always possible. Magma was tested
with multiple Airspan eNodeB models configured through NetSpan management
software.
Magma also includes first-class support to track the state and data usage of
manually provisioned eNodeBs.

To register your eNodeB, first make sure to disable
the DHCP server provided on the Gateway on the NMS configuration panel.

![Disabling Gateway DHCP server](assets/nms/disable_dhcp_gw.png)

After this, you can add the eNodeB basic information under the RAN section
of the eNodeB configuration, select `eNodeB Managed Externally` and add the
fields based on the provisioning of the radio.

![Register unmanaged eNodeB](assets/nms/register_unmanaged_enb.png)

After registering the eNodeB, the last step is to add its serial number to the
list of Connected eNodeBs on the Access Gateway

When manually configuring eNodeBs, make sure the eNodeB configuration matches
that of the Magma cellular configuration. Pay special attention to the
configuration of `PLMN`, `EARFCN` and `TAC`.

### Basic Troubleshooting

When manually configuring your eNodeB, you can use the manufacturers tools or
interfaces to monitor and troubleshoot the eNodeB configuration.

You can also listen to the `S1` interface traffic and validate a proper `S1`
setup and handshake. Below are the `SCTP` packets exchanged between the eNodeB
and MME.

```text
Source        Destination    Protocol  Length   Info
10.0.2.246    10.0.2.1       SCTP      66       INIT
10.0.2.1      10.0.2.246     SCTP      298      INIT_ACK
10.0.2.246    10.0.2.1       SCTP      278      COOKIE_ECHO
10.0.2.1      10.0.2.246     SCTP      60       COOKIE_ACK
10.0.2.246    10.0.2.1       S1AP      106      S1SetupRequest
10.0.2.1      10.0.2.246     SCTP      62       SACK
10.0.2.1      10.0.2.246     S1AP      90       S1SetupResponse
10.0.2.246    10.0.2.1       SCTP      62       SACK
10.0.2.246    10.0.2.1       SCTP      66       HEARTBEAT
10.0.2.1      10.0.2.246     SCTP      66       HEARTBEAT_ACK
```

Once your eNodeB starts transmitting, UEs may attempt to attach to your
network. Your AGW will reject these attach requests due to authentication
failure until you add the corresponding IMSI to the subscriber database.

Continue to the next section to register your subscribers and configure your
APNs to start serving traffic.
