# TSC Processes

This document provides a collection of norms for how the Magma TSC operates.

## Positions

### TSC

Positions are elected via majority vote from the codeowners. Last until earliest of:

- 1-year term (pending TSC-wide phase-adjustment)
- Resignation
- TSC-majority vote to end term early

### TSC chair

Position is elected via majority vote from the TSC. Last until earliest of:

- 1-year term (pending TSC-wide phase-adjustment)
- Resignation
- TSC-majority vote to end term early

## Voting considerations

- Majority vote means >50% of the vote -- a tie vote means the motion fails
- There is no consideration for quorum for the following votes -- motions require yea votes from >50% of the full voting body
    - Ending a TSC member's term early
    - Voting in the TSC chair

## Additional norms

- In the event of disagreements within the TSC, codeowners, or community on whether bylaws and norms were followed, or whether the set of bylaws and norms are reasonable, escalation routes first through the Governance Board, then finally to LinuxFoundation when necessary
- TSC chair election to align with calendar year
- Phase-adjustment: TSC 1-year terms to be phased such that, at a uniform turnover rate, full turnover would not occur in less than 6 months. E.g., if the TSC had 6 members, phase the term end-dates out by 1 month each
- TSC votes are held in the magma-tsc-voting@lists.magmacore.org mailing list
- Codeowner votes are held in `#governance-codeowners-private` via the Accord bot
