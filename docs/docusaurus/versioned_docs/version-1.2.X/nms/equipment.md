### Gateway Overview
![gateway_overview2](assets/nms/userguide/gateway_overview2.png)
* Chart to display gateway checkins. Using a time range selector, the gateway checkin chart can be filtered to view the frequency of checkins over the last 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, 7 days, 14 days and 30 days.

* Gateway overview table with a selector to view either **status** or **upgrade** view of the gateways in the network.
    * **Status** table columns include (Name, ID, #eNodeBs, #subscribers, Health, Last checkin Time). The gateway ID link can be clicked to open the gateway detail page for a specific gateway. Each row comes with an action menu with options to view, edit and delete a gateway.
    * **Upgrade** table columns include (Name, ID, Hardware ID, Current Version, Tier, and editable actions to modify the tier).
* Buttons to **add a new gateway **and to configure **upgrade tiers.**

#### Gateway detail
Each gateway detail page comprises of overview, events, logs, alerts and config sections. Additionally, the gateway detail page has a reboot button at the right top corner of the page.

* Log table displays the date, service, log type and log text. The log table comes with a search bar which can be used to search for arbitrary text within the logs. Regular expressions can also be used. For example, *001010000000001 can be used to filter all logs for a particular IMSI.
* Log page comes with a datetime selector which can be used to filter log chart and log table within a selected time window.
* Log page also comes with an export button that can be used to export all the logs within the particular time window, for a specific search query.


##### Alerts

* EPC section
* Ran section
* Aggregation section for enabling and disabling log aggregation and event aggregation for a specific gateway

#### Upgrade Tiers Dialog
![upgrade_tiers1](assets/nms/userguide/upgrade_tiers1.png)
* This dialog displays the tier table and supported versions (i.e. versions from a stable channel)
* Tier table lists all the available tiers within the network and the versions they are associated with. The version field can be edited to select one of the supported versions. Any arbitrary version can be provided as well.

## eNodeB Dashboard

### eNodeB overview
![enodeb_overview1](assets/nms/userguide/enodeb_overview1.png)
Chart to display the total throughput of all eNodeBs. It comes along with a datetime selector to filter the chart within a specific time window.
* eNodeB overview table lists all the eNodeBs in the network. Table columns includes Name, Serial, Session state name, Health and Last reported time. Clicking individual eNodeB serial links opens the eNodeB detail page for the selected eNodeB. Each table row has an action menu to view, edit and remove the eNodeB.
* Button to **add a new eNodeB**

### eNodeB detail
eNodeB detail comprises of the following sections
#### Overview page
![enodeb_detail1](assets/nms/userguide/enodeb_detail1.png)
* Information (eNodeB name, serial)
* Status KPIs including (Health, Gateway ID, Transmit Enabled and MME connected)
* Throughput chart for the selected eNodeB - it comes with a date time selector to filter the chart within a specific time window.

#### Config page
![enodeb_detail2](assets/nms/userguide/enodeb_detail2.png)
* Information (eNodeB name, serial and description of eNodeB)
* RAN section

# Equipment Configuration
The following sections show step-by-step screenshots of configuring gateways, eNodeBs, subscribers, networks, policies and APN.

## Gateway configuration

The same gateway configuration dialog is used for 'add' as well as 'edit'. The dialog has 4 main tabs:
* Gateway Information -
    to configure gateway specific details including name, id, hardware UUID, description,
    current version and challenge key. The challenge key is a base64 bytestring of the key in DER format.

* Aggregation -
    to enable or disable event aggregation or log aggregation service on the gateway. Data generated
    from event and log aggregation is used to display the tables and graphs for the event and log
    sections of the Gateway dashboard.

* EPC -
    To configure EPC level parameters including Nat, IP and DNS configuration of the gateway.

* RAN -
    To configure RAN level parameters including PCI value and eNodeBs registered with the gateway and to select if
    transmit should be enabled across the eNodeBs.

### Adding a new gateway
As shown below, the Gateway add button is available on the Gateway Overview page.
![gateway_add_button](assets/nms/userguide/gateway_add_button.png)

As the user clicks **save and continue** and proceeds to the next tab, the gateway configuration
will be persisted. The user can either choose to configure all paramters at once
or skip and configure them at a later point of time by editing the configuration
from the gateway detail section.
