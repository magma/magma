# UE Usage Metering

Magma currently supports basic usage metering. This allows for real-time
monitoring of data usage specified with the following labels:
- `IMSI`
- `session_id`
- `traffic direction`

This feature is currently built to enable post-pay charging.

Metering information is available through our metrics REST endpoint.
The metric name used is `ue_traffic`.

### Configuring Metering

As a pre-requisite, ensure you have the following:

* a functional orc8r
* a configured LTE network
* a configured LTE gateway with eNodeB
* subscribers that can attach to your LTE gateway
* network running in un-federated mode

In un-federated mode, the `policydb` service on the LTE gateway acts 
as a lightweight PCRF, and federated support for metering is not currently 
supported.

To enable metering for a single subscriber, 
the following steps need to be completed:

1. A rating group configured with infinite, metered credit
2. A policy rule configured with the above rating group
3. Your policy rule assigned to the subscriber to be metered

If you do not have a NMS setup with integration to Magma's REST API, the 
details below should help. If your `orc8r` is functional, you should be able to 
manually access the Swagger API.

**Configuring Rating Group**

`/networks/{network_id}/rating_groups`

Configure with the following JSON as an example. Modify the ID as necessary.

```
{
  "id": 1,
  "limit_type": "INFINITE_METERED"
}
```

**Configuring Policy Rule**

`/networks/{network_id}/policies/rules`

Configure with the following JSON as an example. Here, the flow list is set 
to allow all traffic. A high priority is also set to override other rules. 
You may need to modify the `rating_group` to match the ID of the rating group 
you configured earlier. Here you also have a chance to directly assign the 
policy to the subscriber you wish to meter for.

```
{
  "app_name": "NO_APP_NAME",
  "app_service_type": "NO_SERVICE_TYPE",
  "assigned_subscribers": [],
  "flow_list": [
    {
      "action": "PERMIT",
      "match": {
        "direction": "UPLINK",
        "ip_proto": "IPPROTO_IP"
      }
    },
    {
      "action": "PERMIT",
      "match": {
        "direction": "DOWNLINK",
        "ip_proto": "IPPROTO_IP"
      }
    }
  ],
  "id": "metering_rule",
  "priority": 10,
  "qos": {
    "max_req_bw_dl": 0,
    "max_req_bw_ul": 0
  },
  "rating_group": 1,
  "tracking_type": "ONLY_OCS"
}
```

**Assigning Policy to Subscriber**

`/lte/{network_id}/subscribers`
`/networks/{network_id}/policies/rules/{rule_id}`

Two endpoints can be used for assigning the metering policy to a subscriber.
Set the `assigned_subscribers` field for a policy rule, or set the 
`active_policies` field for a subscriber.


### Verifying Metering

It may take up to a minute for the update configurations to propagate to 
the LTE gateway, where they should be received and stored by `policydb`.

Check the metrics REST endpoint to verify that metering data is being recorded.

### Debugging Metering

On subscriber attach, `policydb` will provide the metered policy to install for 
the subscriber. By tailing these logs, it is possible to verify that the 
configurations are being received.
`journalctl -fu magma@policydb`

`pipelined` is the service which is responsible for enforcement, by use of OVS.
By using the CLI tool, it is possible to verify that the policy rule is being 
installed for the user. The policy id will be listed if installed, along with 
tracked usage.
`pipelined_cli.py debug display_flows`
This command may need to be run as root.

`sessiond` is responsible for aggregating metrics and sending metering through 
our metrics pipeline. To check the tracked metrics for metering, and the 
`sessiond` service, run the following:
`service303_cli.py metrics sessiond`
