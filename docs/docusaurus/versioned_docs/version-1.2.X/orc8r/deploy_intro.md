# Introduction

This section walks through building, installing, and upgrading a production
Orchestrator deployment.

This includes building required artifacts (container images, Helm charts),
deploying to Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), and upgrading between
Orchestrator release versions.

## Prerequisites

Before deployment, it may be useful to read through the
[Magma prerequisites](../basics/prerequisites.md) and
[Magma quick start guide](../basics/quick_start_guide.md) sections.

Familiarity with the following is assumed

- AWS
- Kubernetes
- Terraform

The instructions in this section have been tested on macOS and Linux. If you
are deploying from a Windows host, some shell commands will likely require
adjustments.

## Deploying specific release

To target a specific release, checkout the Magma repository's relevant release
branch when building artifacts. This is also a great place to find relevant
Terraform values.

Some Terraform values for recent Orchestrator releases are summarized below

### v1.2.0
Verified with Terraform version `0.13.1`. The latest Terraform version will
likely work as well.

- `v1.2` [patch branch](https://github.com/magma/magma/tree/v1.2)
- `github.com/magma/magma//orc8r/cloud/deploy/terraform/orc8r-aws?ref=v1.2`
Terraform module source
- `1.4.35` Helm chart version

### v1.1.0
Verified with Terraform version `0.12.29`. The latest Terraform version will
likely work as well.

- `v1.1` [patch branch](https://github.com/magma/magma/tree/v1.1)
- `github.com/magma/magma//orc8r/cloud/deploy/terraform/orc8r-aws?ref=v1.1`
Terraform module source
- `1.4.21` Helm chart version
