# Pipelined
## Overview

Pipelined is the control application that programs rules in the Open vSwitch (OVS). In implementation, Pipelined is a set of network services that are chained together. These services can be chained and enabled/disabled through the REST API in orchestrator.

### Open vSwitch & OpenFlow

[Open vSwitch (OVS)](http://docs.openvswitch.org/en/latest/intro/what-is-ovs/) is a virtual switch that implements the [OpenFlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenFlow) protocol. Pipelined services program rules in OVS to implement basic PCEF functionality for user plane traffic.

The OpenFlow pipeline of OVS contains 255 flow tables. Pipelined splits the tables into two categories:
 - Main table (Table 1 - 20)
 - Scratch table (Table 21 - 254)

![OpenFlow Pipeline](https://github.com/facebookincubator/magma/blob/master/docs/readmes/assets/openflow-pipeline.png?raw=true)

[*Source: OpenFlow Specification*](https://www.opennetworking.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/openflow-spec-v1.4.0.pdf)

Each service is associated with a main table, which is used to forward traffic between different services. Services can claim scratch tables optionally, which are used for complex flow matching and processing within the same service. See [Services](#services) for a detailed breakdown of each Pipelined services.

Each flow table is programmed by a single service through OpenFlow and it can contain multiple flow entries. When a packet is forwarded to a table, it is matched against the flow entries installed in the table and the highest-priority matching flow entry is selected. The actions defined in the selected flow entry will be applied to the packet.

### Ryu

[Ryu](https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html) is a Python library that provides an API wrapper for programming OVS.

Pipelined services are implemented as Ryu applications (controllers) under the hood. Ryu apps are single-threaded entities that communicate using an event model. Generally, each controller is assigned a table and manages the its flows.

## Services
### Static Services

Static services include mandatory services (such as OAI and inout) which are always enabled, and services with a set table number. Static services can be configured in the YAML config.

### Service types

Services(controllers) are split into two: Physical and Logical.
Physical controllers: arpd, access_control.
Logical controllers: dpi, enforcement.


### Configurable Services

These services can be enabled and ordered from orchestrator cloud. `mconfig` is used to stream the list of enabled service to gateway.

Table numbers are dynamically assigned to these services and depenedent on the order.

```
    -------------------------------
    |          Table X            |
    |            DPI              |
    |- Assigns App ID to each new |
    |  IP tuple encountered       |
    |- Optional, requires separate|
    |  DPI engine                 |

                                        |- Keeps track of flow stats  |

                                        |                             |
                                        -------------------------------
```

### Reserved registers

[Nicira extension](https://ryu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nicira_ext_ref.html#module-ryu.ofproto.nicira_ext) for OpenFlow provides additional registers (0 - 15) that can be set and matched. The table below lists the registers used in Pipelined.

Register |    Type    |         Use          |           Set by
---------|------------|----------------------|-----------------------------
metadata | Write-once | Stores IMSI          | Table 0 (GTP application)
reg0     | Scratch    | Temporary Arithmetic | Any
reg3     | Scratch    | Temporary Arithmetic | Any
reg1     | Global     | Direction bit        | Table 1 (inout application)
reg2     | Local      | Policy number        | Enforcement app
reg10    | Global     | App ID               | DPI app
reg4     | Local      | Policy version number| Enforcement app
reg6     | Global     | Passthrough flag     | Ue Mac app
reg7     | Local      | Vlan Tag             | Vlan learn app

### Resilience

Pipelined service is restart resilient and can seamlessly recover from service restarts.
This is achieved by:
  1) Querying all flows on controller startup. This is done through a separate startup flow controller that will handle querying all initial stats.
  2) Comparing the flows received from step 1, with the flows obtained from sessiond setup() call
  3) Activating new flows that are not present
  4) Deactivate flows that are not in the sessiond call but are active
This works because ovs secure fail mode doesn't remove flows whenever the controller disconnects.

Note:
Currently we reinsert some flows instead of doing the diff logic on them(f.e. enforcement redirection flows as they need async dhcp request resolution, other tables that don't hold and session data(inout, ue_mac, etc.) but this will be added later).

## Testing

### Scripts

Some scripts in `/lte/gateway/python/scripts` may come in handy for testing. These scripts should be ran in virtualenv so `magtivate` needs to be ran first to enter the virtualenv .

- `pipelined_cli.py` can be used to to make calls to the rpc API
    - Some commands require sudo privilege. To run the script as sudo in virtualenv, use `venvsudo pipelined_cli.py`
    - Example:

```bash
$ ./pipelined_cli.py enforcement activate_dynamic_rule --imsi IMSI12345 --rule_id rule1 --priority 110 --hard_timeout 60
```

```bash
$ venvsudo ./pipelined_cli.py enforcement display_flows
```

- `fake_user.py` can be used to debug Pipelined without an eNodeB. It creates a fake_user OVS port and an interface with the same name and IP (10.10.10.10). Any traffic sent through the interface would traverse the pipeline, as if its sent from a user ip (192.168.128.200 by default).
    - Example:

```bash
$ ./fake_user.py create --imsi IMSI12345
$ sudo curl --interface fake_user -vvv --ipv4 http://www.google.com > /dev/null
```


### Unit Tests

See the [Unit Test README](pipelined_tests.md) for more details.

### Integration Tests

Traffic integration tests cover the end to end flow of Pipelined. See the [Integration Test README](s1ap_tests.md) for more details.
