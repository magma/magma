# eNodeB Configuration
## Prerequisites

Make sure you follow the instructions in "[Deploying Orchestrator](../orc8r/deploy_intro)" for successful
installation of Orchestrator and the instructions in "[AGW Configuration](config_agw)" to provision and
configure your Access Gateway (AGW).

## S1 interface
Connect your eNodeB to the `eth1` interface of Magma gateway. Magma uses `eth1`
as the default `S1` interface. If you have more than one eNodeB, use an L2
switch to connect all `S1` interfaces. For debugging purposes, you may find it
particularly useful to do the following:

1. Configure a managed L2 switch (e.g. [this NETGEAR](https://www.amazon.com/NETGEAR-GS108T-200NAS-GS108Tv2-Lifetime-Protection/dp/B07PS6Z162/))
to mirror port X and port Y to port Z.
2. Connect port X of that switch to the `eth1` interface on your AGW.
3. Connect the WAN interface on your enodeB to port Y on the switch.
4. Connect your host to port Z on the switch.

This will allow you to do live packet captures with Wireshark from your host to
debug the S1 interface between the enodeB and the AGW (filter for SCTP).

## Automatic configuration
*Magma officially supports auto-configuration of the following devices:*
* Baicells Nova-243 Outdoor FDD/TDD eNodeB
  - Firmware Version: BaiBS_RTS_3.1.6
* Baicells mBS1100 LTE-TDD Base Station
  - Firmware Version: BaiStation_V100R001C00B110SPC003
* Baicells Neutrino-244 ID FDD/TDD enodeB

*Magma supports the following management protocols:*
* TR-069 (CWMP)

*Magma supports configuration of the following data models:*
* TR-196 data model
* TR-181 data model

The Magma team plans to add support for more devices and management protocols.

To handle automatic configuration of eNodeB devices on your network, Magma
uses the `enodebd` service. The `enodebd` service is responsible for handling
the O&M interface between Magma and any connected eNodeB. The `enodebd` service
can be disabled if you configure your eNodeB devices manually.

### Baicells

Use the enodeB's management interface to set the management server URL to
`baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080`. Magma uses DNS hijacking to point the eNodeB to
the configuration server being run by enodebd. `baiomc.cloudapp.net:48080`
will point to `192.88.99.142`, the IP address that the TR-069 ACS is
being hosted on.

## Provisioning Your eNodeB on NMS

Get the serial number of your eNodeB, you'll need it to register the device.
On the NMS, navigate to "eNodeB Devices" in the sidebar, and hit "Add EnodeB".
Configure the RAN parameters as necessary. Note that fields left blank will
be inherited from either the network or gateway LTE parameters:

![Configuring an eNodeB](assets/nms/configure_enb.png)

Then, go back to the "Gateways" page and edit the LTE configuration of your
AGW. Enter the serial number of the enodeB you just provisioned into the
"Registered eNodeBs" field, then hit save.

### Basic Troubleshooting
After connecting your eNodeB(s) to the gateway through the `eth1` interface, you
may want to check a few things if auto-configuration is not working.

Magma will be running a DHCP server to assign an IP address to your connected
eNodeB. Check if an IP address gets assigned to your eNodeB by either checking
the eNodeB UI or monitoring the `dnsd` service.

```
journalctl -u magma@dnsd -f
# Check for a similar log
# DHCPDISCOVER(eth1) 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPOFFER(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPREQUEST(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
# DHCPACK(eth1) 10.0.2.246 48:bf:74:07:68:ee
```

Use the `enodebd_cli.py` tool to check basic status of eNodeB(s). It also allows
for querying the value of parameters, setting them, and sending reboot requests
to the eNodeB. The following example gets the status of all connected eNodeBs.

```
enodebd_cli.py get_all_status
# --- eNodeB Serial: 120200002618AGP0001 ---
# IP Address..................10.0.2.246
# eNodeB connected.....................1
# eNodeB Configured....................1
# Opstate Enabled......................1
# RF TX on.............................1
# RF TX desired........................1
# GPS Connected........................0
# PTP Connected........................0
# MME Connected........................1
# GPS Longitude...............113.902069
# GPS Latitude.................22.932018
# FSM State...............Completed provisioning eNB. Awaiting new Inform.
```

It may take time for the eNodeB to start transmitting because `enodebd` will
reboot the eNodeB to apply new configurations. Monitor the progress of `enodebd`
using the following command

```
journalctl -u magma@enodebd -f
# Check for a similar log
# INFO:root:Successfully configured CPE parameters!
```

## Manual configuration
Manual configuration of connected eNodeB(s) is always possible. Magma was tested
with multiple Airspan eNodeB models configured through NetSpan management
software.
When manually configuring eNodeBs, make sure the eNodeB configuration matches
that of the Magma cellular configuration. Pay special attention to the
configuration of `PLMN`, `EARFCN` and `TAC`.

### Basic Troubleshooting
When manually configuring your eNodeB, you can use the manufacturers tools or
interfaces to monitor and troubleshoot the eNodeB configuration.

You can also listen to the `S1` interface traffic and validate a proper `S1`
setup and handshake. Below are the `SCTP` packets exchanged between the eNodeB
and MME.

## Adding subscribers

Once your eNodeB starts transmitting, UEs may attempt to attach to your
network. Your AGW will reject these attach requests due to authentication
failure until you add the corresponding IMSI to the subscriber database.

On the NMS, go to "Subscribers", then "Add Subscriber". The SIM secrets can be
entered either in hex or base64-encoded binary:

![Adding a subscriber](assets/nms/add_sub.png)

Subscriber information will eventually propagate to the AGW. You can verify
using the CLI command `"subscriber_cli.py list"`

## Validating UE connectivity

Validating UE connectivity can be done from the UE side, MME side, or by
listening to traffic on the `S1` interface.
Below is a typical UE attach procedure as captured on the `S1` interface.
