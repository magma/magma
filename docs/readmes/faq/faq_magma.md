# Frequently Asked Questions

This section lists some of the commonly asked questions related to Magma operation.

## Access Gateway

### How can I check the status of eNodeB(s) connected on a particular gateway?

- Run `sudo enodebd_cli.py get_all_status` to check eNodeB(s) status.
- **NOTE:** Output of this command will only show eNodeB(s) configured with TR069 protocol.

### How can I see different interfaces of gateway?

- Run `sudo ip addr` to see all configured interfaces.
- Commonly, interface `eth0` is used for internet connectivity and `eth1` is used for RAN connectivity.
- You may run `ping google.com -I eth0` to check AGW connectivity with internet.
- Also, you may run `ping <eNodeB IP> -I eth1` to check AGW connectivity with eNodeB. You can get eNodeB IP from `enodeb_cli` as mentioned in above question.

### How can I see attached subscribers list on a particular gateway and their browsing status?

- Run `sudo mobility_cli.py get_subscriber_table`, to see all attached subscribers.
- Note down the IP obtained by the user from above command, then run `sudo pipelined_cli.py debug display_flows | grep <USER IP>` for packet flow info of that user.

### How can I check services running on a gateway and their status?

- **Check all services:** `sudo service magma@* status`.
- **Check specific service:** `sudo service magma@<SERVICE_NAME> status`. e.g. `sudo service magma@enodebd status`.

### How can I collect logs for a particular service?

- Run `sudo journalctl -fu magma@<SERVICE NAME>`, e.g. for enodeb service, run `sudo journalctl -fu magma@enodebd`.

### How can I check the status of the OVS module on a gateway?

- Run `sudo ovs-vsctl show` to check.

### How can I capture packets for troubleshooting?

- You can use general purpose tcpdump command to capture traffic at any of your interfaces. e.g. run `sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w /tmp/capture.pcap` to capture packet at eth1 interface.

### What are the common troubleshooting logs in gateway?

- **syslog:** `/var/log/syslogs`.
- **MME logs:** `/var/log/mme.log`.
- **eNodeB logs:** `/var/log/enodebd.log`.

### Where can I find the configuration of a gateway?

- File `/var/opt/magma/configs/gateway.mconfig` is the configuration streamed down from Orchestrator.
- Any custom static configs will also be in directory `/var/opt/magma/configs` with a `.yml` extension.
- Default static configs are located at `/etc/magma/configs`.
- systemd unit files are located at `/etc/system/systemd`.

### How can I restart gateway services?

- There are 2 options to restart gateway services. First from CLI and other from NMS UI.
- To restart services from CLI, login to AGW node, then perform below steps:
    - Run `sudo service magma@* stop` to stop services.
    - Then, run `sudo service magma@magmad restart` to restart services.
- To restart services from NMS UI, perform below steps:
    - Login to NMS UI and go to **Gateways** option from left hand pane menu.
    - Then, click on **edit** option against the gateway for which you wish to reboot services.
    - From the popup window, select tab **COMMANDS**. Then, check section **Reboot**.
    - Click on **Restart Services** to restart all AGW services.

### How can I reboot the gateway?

- There are 2 options to reboot gateway. First from CLI and other from NMS UI.
- To reboot AGW from CLI, login to AGW node, then run `sudo init 6` to reboot whole AGW node.

    - Login to NMS UI and go to **Gateways** option from left hand pane menu.
    - Then, click on **edit** option against the gateway which you wish to reboot.
    - From the popup window, select tab **COMMANDS**. Then, check section **Reboot**.
    - Click on **Reboot** to reboot the AGW node.

### Does the AGW support IPv6?

- IPv6 and dual stack IPv4v6 session support is implemented for Magma v1.7 and later.

### How to change hardware UUID of AGW?

- Hardware UUID is in `/etc/snowflake`.
- Delete file `/etc/snowflake` and restart magma@magmad systemd service, which will create new one.
- **NOTE** If you reinstall magma, the UUID hardware ID will change.

### How to switch between info/debug mode in mme logs?

- Modify `/var/opt/magma/configs/mme.yml` and add the line `"log_level: DEBUG"`,
- Restart the mme service with `sudo service magma@mme restart`.
- **NOTE** Expect impact of service while doing above procedure.

### What's the command to flush the redis state?

- The command in AGW`redis-cli -p 6380 FLUSHALL` will flush the redis state

### Where can I get more information about services running in Magma?

- <https://github.com/magma/magma/tree/master/docs/readmes/lte>

### How can I detach/purge a subscriber from AGW?

- The command `s6a_service_cli.py delete <IMSI>,<IMSI>` will detach the list of subscriber from MME.
- Detached subscribers will need to reattach to the network.

### How to change MME IP address?

- Edit the IP address of eth1 interface: `sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces.d/eth1`
- Then restart network manager: `sudo systemctl restart networking`
- And check IP again: `ip a s eth1`

### How can I check if a given subscriber is idle or connected?

- SSH into the the AGW
- Fetch the subscriber's state using its IMSI:
    - `state_cli.py parse IMSI716770120257790:MME`
- Looking at the `ecm_state` configuration, the value:
    - 0 - Indicates the user is IDLE
    - 1 - Indicates the user is CONNECTED

## Orchestrator

### How can I check production pods in Orchestrator running on Kubernetes?

- **For all pods:** `kubectl --namespace orc8r get pods`.
- **Logs of a particular pod:** `kubectl --namespace orc8r logs -f <CONTROLLER PODNAME>`.
- **NOTE:** In above commands, please use the actual namespace after `--namespace` you have chosen to install orc8r in.

### How can I test Orchestrator connection with Gateway?

- Login to Gateway, then run `sudo checkin_cli.py`.

### Where can I find API endpoint?

- If you have followed the [install guide](../orc8r/deploy_install.md), it'll be at `https://api.youdomain.com/swagger/v1/ui/`.
- You will need to load the `admin_operator.pfx` certificate into your keychain/browser, otherwise, API access will be blocked.

### How can I check the services running in Orchestrator?

- List the running pods with `kubectl --namespace orc8r get pods`
- Grab the name of orc8r-controller pods, they are in the format `orc8r-controller-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy`
- Collect the state of services on each pod: `kubectl --namespace orc8r exec orc8r-controller-xxxxxxxxxx-yyyyy  bash -- supervisorctl status`

### How to verify which services are running in Orc8r-controller?

- **Get the controller pods:** `kubectl --namespace orc8r get pods`.
- **Execute the command in the pod:** `kubectl --namespace orc8r exec <CONTROLLER PODNAME> supervisorctl status`.

## NMS

### What is an NMS (Network Management System)?

- NMS is a simple UI based solution provided to manage, configuring, and monitor the network effectively. You can monitor various network metrics,  configure and monitor alerts, subscribers, gateways, eNodeBs etc.

- Administrative Tools → Alerts → Select Network → **Sync Alert**.

## Miscellaneous

### How to disable dhcp in AGW for eNB?

- Network Management → Equipment → Gateways → Select the Gateway → Config → RAN → Edit → Disable eNodeB DHCP service.

### What is a core dump?

- When AGW services crash with a segmentation fault, a core dump is generated.
- Core dumps are generated in format `core-<timestamp>-<process_name>[-<PID>]` under `/tmp` folder.
- Use **GDB** tool to analyse them as  `cd /tmp/<core-directory>/` `gunzip <core gzip file>` `gdb /usr/local/bin/<process name> <unzipped core file>`.
