# Continuous Integration Checks
When a PR is submitted to the Magma repo, a suite of Continuous Integration tests and analysis are executed. Checks marked as required must pass for a PR to merge.

This document attempts to give high level explanations of the purpose of each check, contacts for questions regarding each test, and expectations around CI flow success.

## How to reach out to a check owner
Below are some resources for finding who to contact:
* [GitHub-to-Slack ID mappings are available](contribute_id_mappings)
* [List of Magma maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/magma/teams/repo-magma-maintain/members)
* [List of `approvers-*` teams and their members](https://github.com/orgs/magma/teams/?query=approvers)
