# Magma Codeowners

This page provides an entry point for understanding Magma's codeowners (maintainers) -- both who they are, and how to become a codeowner yourself.

Instructions on joining our Slack workspace is provided in the [Magma community page](https://www.magmacore.org/community/).

## Current codeowners

This section provides the GitHub-to-Slack mappings for all [Magma maintainers](https://github.com/orgs/magma/teams/repo-magma-maintain/members).

### Magma technical leads

Magma technical leads are an informal subset of the Magma maintainers, organized to provide an entry point for each top-level component during public development.

## Become a codeowner

### Howto

To become a codeowner, send a message in the `#governance-codeowners` channel saying "I'd like to be considered as a Magma codeowner for component XXX".

From there, an existing codeowner will shepherd the request. This will proceed through the following steps

- An existing codeowner will need to initiate your nomination
- Your nomination will be voted on, and needs to receive a majority vote from the current codeowners

### Desired qualities

In order to receive a nomination, the project requests the following qualities in relation to the Magma project, with example ways to fulfill

- Solid contributions history (example: 7+ PRs merged)
- Solid code review history (example: 10+ code reviews)
- Demonstrated ownership of particular component (example: contributions and code review for *sessiond* service)
- Demonstrated technical leadership of particular component (example: driving component design/evolution during code review, and/or through writing 1+ design docs)

Please note that this set of qualities is not an exact requirement -- if you're interested in supporting the project as a codeowner, please reach out! We'd love to work with you, and work on a path toward you becoming a Magma codeowner.
