# Test FeG

This guide covers tips for quickly validating Federation Gateway changes.


## Run tests on the host

The normal way to run FeG unit tests is `$MAGMA_ROOT/feg/gateway/docker/build.py --tests`. This
builds and brings up a test container, then runs the full set of unit
tests.

The script also includes additional commands, such as linters and formatters. 
When committing changes in FeG, use `$MAGMA_ROOT/feg/gateway/docker/build.py --precommit` to run a set of recommended commands.
