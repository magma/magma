# Introduction

Orchestrator upgrades generally follow a standard pattern

- Upgrade deployment tooling (Terraform, Helm, etc.)
- Terraform new infrastructure and application artifacts
- Run data migrations and other post-upgrade steps

Every new minor and major release (i.e. non-hotfix) will have a corresponding documentation section on upgrading from the prior release. Upgrade procedures are only documented for adjacent releases. Upgrades which skip versions (e.g. v1.1 to v1.3) are not explicitly supported at this time.

Before every upgrade, we strongly suggest taking a DB snapshot in case you decide that you need to roll back your application. While the application components are stateless and can be upgraded or downgraded at any time, the data migrations that come with each release are not always reversible.

If you are using local Terraform state (the default), ensure all Terraform state files (i.e. [`terraform.tfstate`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/index.html)) are located in your working directory before proceeding. This means `terraform show` should list existing state (rather than outputting `No state`).

Finally, we assume `MAGMA_ROOT` is set as described in the [deployment intro](./deploy_intro.md).
