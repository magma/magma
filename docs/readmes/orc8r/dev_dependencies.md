# Module Dependencies

Within Magma, each module (orc8r, lte, cwf, feg, wifi, fbinternal)
is in charge of generating and defining their own API objects, specifically
defined as Swagger objects. A module's Swagger objects may depend on those
from other modules. This results in the following module dependency tree.
