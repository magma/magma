# Test Orchestrator

This guide covers tips for quickly validating Orchestrator changes.

## Context

The Orc8r build process is managed by [`build.py`](https://github.com/magma/magma/blob/master/orc8r/cloud/docker/build.py).

See `build.py --help` for more information.

### Pre-build: code generation

- Command: `build.py --generate`
- CI check: `insync-checkin`
- About: generated files are checked-in to version control. You can regenerate these files by running `build.py --generate`, then committing the resulting changes.

### Pre-build: lint

- Command: `build.py --lint`
- CI check: `cloud-lint`
- About: lint cloud Go code for common errors and non-idiomatic formatting

### Build

- Command: `build.py --all --parallel`
- CI check: `orc8r-build`
- About: build all [container images](https://github.com/magma/magma/blob/master/orc8r/cloud/docker/docker-compose.yml): `controller` and `nginx`

### Test

- Command: `build.py --tests`
- CI check: `cloud-test`
- About: run all Orc8r unit tests. Builds and brings up a test and DB container, then runs the full set of Go unit tests.

## Tip #1: run tests on the host

Using `build.py --tests` is effective, but can be heavyweight.

Instead, you can also run tests directly from your IDE. We provide a default set of IntelliJ run configurations to support running all tests in one click, directly from IntelliJ.

### Default run configurations

The default run configurations are checked in under `.run/`. You'll also need to install the [Multirun plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7248-multirun).

`Go Test` configurations should look something like

![intellij_subproject_configs](assets/orc8r/intellij_subproject_configs.png)

`Multirun` configurations should include `go test all`, and look something like

### Install prereqs

Our tests are not fully isolated from their environment. To set up your environment for testing, run

```bash
cd ${MAGMA_ROOT}/orc8r/cloud/ && make tools  # install tools
cd ${MAGMA_ROOT}/orc8r/cloud/docker && ./run.py  # bring up postgres_test
```

### Run tests

Now you should be able to run the full set of tests, without rebuilding any container images, for

- a particular subproject e.g. `go test lte`
- the entire codebase `go test all`

### Custom run configurations

You can also manually create your own run configurations. Depending on the test, you may need to include the following environment variables

- `TEST_DATABASE_HOST=localhost`
- `TEST_DATABASE_PORT_MARIA=3307`
- `TEST_DATABASE_PORT_POSTGRES=5433`

## Tip #2: build deployment-specific image

The build process follows a subproject-based architecture. The top-level build file, `orc8r/cloud/Makefile`, defines a set of generic commands, which each subproject implements, e.g. `orc8r/cloud/go/Makefile`.

The set of subprojects is determined by the `MAGMA_MODULES` environment variable, which is defined during the container image build process. The default subprojects include `orc8r`, `lte`, `feg`, etc.

By default, all subprojects are included in the build. If desired, you can use e.g. `build.py --deployment orc8r` to build a deployment-specific set of subprojects. This can reduce build time by up to 50%.
