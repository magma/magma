# Overview
Magma NMS provides an enterprise grade GUI for provisioning and operating magma based networks.
It enables operators to create and manage:
- Organizations
- Networks
- Gateways and eNodeBs
- Subscribers
- Policies and APNs

It also aims to simplify operating magma networks by providing:
* A dashboard of all access gateways and top-level status to determine overall health of infrastructure components at a glance
* KPIs and status of a specific access gateway to triage potential infrastructure issues that might need escalation
* A dashboard of all subscribers and their top-level status to determine the overall health of internet service at a glance
* KPIs and service status of an individual subscriber to triage issues reported by that subscriber
* Firing alerts displayed on the dashboard to escalate/remediate the issue appropriately
* Fault remediation procedures including the ability to remotely reboot gateways
* The ability to peform gateway software upgrades
* Ability to remotely troubleshoot through [call tracing features.](../howtos/call_tracing)
