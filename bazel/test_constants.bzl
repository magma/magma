This file holds constants that are used for bazel test definitions. Especially
for test-tagging, this is meant to ensure that tags are used consistently.

Constants can be imported in a build file via
load("//bazel:test_constants.bzl", "CONSTANT1", "CONSTANT2")

Tags are defined as lists, i.e., you can add them in your build file via
list concatenation:
    load("//bazel:test_constants.bzl", "TAG_FOO", "TAG_BAR")
    ...
    tags = TAG_FOO + TAG_BAR

# Used for a test that should be executed manually (read explicitly). This

# Used for a "sudo test" that needs to be executed by a user with sudo
# privileges. This is a restriction mainly known for some Python tests.
# Note: for now a sudo test is also tagged as "manual".
