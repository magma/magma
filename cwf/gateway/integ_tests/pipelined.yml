# This configuration represents an access gateway with a local internal OVS
# device as the "default route", with a single "uplink" port acting as an L2
# device on port 1. You might need to change this based on the situation.
# OpenFlow ports can be numerical ports, or they can be 'local', which
# corresponds to an 'internal' OVS port; we'll translate into the relevant
# constant for the supported OF protocol by the pipeline.
