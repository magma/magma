// rateLimitCore A zap logger which has rate-limiter to limit the rate of logs
// all logs that are written through this logger are rate-limited without regard to their content
// Note the difference between this & the zapcore.Sampler() which takes a sample of a log stream.
// zapcore.Sampler is more appropriate when your log stream is high-rate by nature (e.g.: you have 100M request per minute so a single log per request is already a huge amount of logs).
// in the above case, sampling is a reasonable approach, so it will sample 1/M of logs. and since the rate is changing moderately over time, M can be adjusted every few month.
// This core is meant at logs which are expected to be at very low-rate (e.g.: Warn() & Error() calls) yet they are caused by an external event (e.g.: parameter received in Rest API), hence in case of a bug of DDOS attack, the rate can be very high
// here we would like to ensure that the external entity *cannot* flood the system with logs, thereby degrading its service.
