An alternative/replacement interface for the Upgrader interface

The main difference is that this interface provides a specialization that
ties into a cloud component which allows coordinating/pacing upgrades.

In order for that to be possible, upgrading must be broken into stages:
1) Initial state
2) Download resources to upgrade
3) Prepare resources for upgrade
4) Upgrade
