	// If ReportError() will return nil, streamer will try to continue streaming
	// If ReportError() will return error != nil - streaming on the stream will be terminated
	ReportError(e error) error
	// Update will be called for every new update received from the stream
	// u is guaranteed to be of a type returned by New(), so - myUpdate := u.(MyDataType) should never panic
	// Update() returns bool indicating whether to continue streaming:
	//   true - continue streaming; false - stop streaming
	//   If Update() returns false -> ReportError() will be called with io.EOF,
	//   in this case, if ReportError() returns nil, streaming will continue with the new connection & stream

	// GetExtraArgs will be called prior to each stream request and its returned value will be used to initialize
	// ExtraArgs field in GetUpdates request payload. Most listeners may just return nil
