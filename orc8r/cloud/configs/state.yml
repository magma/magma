# TODO(#10294): remove enable_automatic_reindexing and enable_singleton_reindex when jobQueue reindexing is removed

# When true, state service handles automatically reindex state indexers.
# When false, reindexing must be handled by the provided CLI.
enable_automatic_reindexing: True

# When true, use a singleton service to reindex states.
# When false, use service(s) and a JobQueue to reindex states.
enable_singleton_reindex: True
