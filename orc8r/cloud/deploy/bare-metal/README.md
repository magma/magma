Deploying Magma on bare metal

The following files need to be edited before deployment can start:

- deploy_ansible_vars.yaml
- orc8r_settings (shell env file)
- deploy_charts.sh

The values that need to be customized are the IP settings for your network and
the passwords which need to be generated. Additionally, you need to host a
docker repo and helm chart repo for orc8r. Further details can be found at
<https://magma.github.io/magma/docs/orc8r/deploy_build#build-and-publish-helm-charts>

Once the config is set, just run the following commands:

./deploy.sh
./deploy_charts.sh

If the deployment succeeds, you will see information on how to log into Magma
web UI.

Note: external-dns configuration is not automatic here because it is intended
for on-premise. You are expected to update DNS or /etc/hosts on your own.
