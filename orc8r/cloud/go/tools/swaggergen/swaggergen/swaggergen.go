Package main holds the swaggergen executable.

swaggergen is a custom tool to generate Go code from Swagger 2.0 spec files
in a way that allows Magma to keep Swagger files modular.
Because one Swagger file can reference definitions from any number of other
Swagger files across modules, we have extended the Swagger spec with some
extra metadata

```
magma-gen-meta:

	  go-package: magma/orc8r/cloud/go/tools/swaggergen/testdata/importer2/models
	  dependencies:
	    - 'orc8r/cloud/go/tools/swaggergen/testdata/base.yml'
	    - 'orc8r/cloud/go/tools/swaggergen/testdata/importer.yml'
	  temp-gen-filename: importer2-swagger.yml
	  output-dir: orc8r/cloud/go/tools/swaggergen/testdata/importer2
	  types:
	    - go-struct-name: ImportingChainDef
		  filename: importing_chain_def_swaggergen.go

```

Think of `dependencies` as an import statement. These filepaths should be
relative to the --root command line flag (defaults to $MAGMA_ROOT).

`tmp-gen-filename` is what you want this file to be named when its contents
are copied into the working directory when a dependent Swagger spec is
being codegened from. All dependent files should reference definitions
inside this file using this filename, as if the file was in the same
directory, e.g.

```
$ref: './importer2-swagger.yml#/definitions/foo'
```

`output-dir` specifies where you want to generate the models to, relative
to --root.

During the code generation step, swaggergen will read the entire dependency
tree for the target Swagger spec and copy all files in that tree to the
working directory as whatever is specified in each file's
`tmp-gen-filename`. Swaggergen will clean up these temporary files before
exiting.

The code generation step is configurable via a go-swagger config file.
Ref: https://goswagger.io/use/template_layout.html

During the code modification step, swaggergen will rewrite references in
the generated code to structs owned by different Swagger spec files to the
implementations in go-package specified by the Swagger spec file which
owns the type. The struct type ownership is defined by the types key of
the meta map.
