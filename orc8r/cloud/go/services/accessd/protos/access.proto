//
// Access Control Related Definitions:
//
//  Access Control is based on the concept of one cloud Entity (operator)
//  represented by its Identity, managing (READ/WRITE access) or
//  monitoring (READ only access) one or more other entities represented by
//  their own Identities
//  Since Identity is a polymorphic type, any entity can play a role of operator
//  as well as any entity can be a 'managed' entity.
//
//  Each Operator 'owns' Access Control List which consists of all entities
//  managed by an operator and their permissions.
//  The operator's access control list (AccessControl.List) is represented by a
//  map of managed/monitored entity Identities keyed by entity's Hash String
//
//  All ACLs are stored as a map keyed by the Operator's Identity unique Hash
//  String provided by the Operator's Identity implementation.
//  Operator's Identity is itself included in the map's value
//  for security & convenience:
//
//  key: Operator Hash String => value: AccessControl.List
//  where:
//      AccessControl.List => {
//        Identity operator
//        map<string, Entity> entities
//      }
//      where:
//          Entity => {
//              Identity id
//              int32 permissions
//          }
//
//  The Identity Hash includes the Identity type, so two Identities may only be
//  equal if they are of the same type.

// Access Control Manager is a service which stores, manages and verifies
// operator Identity objects and their rights to access (read/write) Entities.
//
// Entities and Operators are represented by generic Identity interface
// (see identity.proto for more info on Identity) and can be of any valid
// Identity type.
//
// Currently only Network Identity types are used for Entities and only Operator
// Identity types are used for operators, since the only planned user for Access
// Control Manager Service is Obsidian. But nothing in the service definition
// and/or implementation limits it to the above mentioned types only.
//
// For instance: it should support without any modifications a case of
// a Gateway Identity (operator) having a READ only access to Magmad Service
// Identity (TBD) representing an entity in this case, or a Service Identity
// having WRITE only access to another Service Identity, etc.
//
// Operators & their ACLs may potentially be scoped within another entity
// (currently scoping is not used). The most obvious use case for the scoping
// would be network scoping, in such a case Operator ACL as well as Operator
// itself would only exist within a single network and will be invisible to
// anyone outside this network. ACLs of scoped operators  will only be allowed to
// hold Identities of similarly scoped entities.
