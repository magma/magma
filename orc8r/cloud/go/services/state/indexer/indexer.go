// Each Indexer should
//   - be owned by a single service
//   - have its generated data exposed by the owning service, i.e. only one other service
//     should access the generated data directly via the storage interface.
//
// Notes
//   - There is an unlikely but existent race condition during a reindex
//     operation, where Index could be called with an outdated version of a state.
//     If indexers care about preventing this race condition:
//     -- add a Reindex method to indexer interface, called in-place of Index
//     during reindex operations
//     -- individual indexers should track received state IDs per version and
//     drop Reindex-ed states with stale versions.
