# This pipeline runs various static analysis (e.g. GCC warnings) against the c / c++ pull requests.
#
# TODO: Move Docker container caching / storage to a repository
#
# TODO: Reduce workflow description duplication across jobs
#   - Option: by use of Workflow Templates per gcc-build-target (need to move docker build to another workflow and requires container repo)
#   - Option: by improving our build system and enabling faster build-all-targets
