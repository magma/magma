# VS Code DevContainer Environment

Documentation on the usage of DevContainer can also be found in the [contributor documentation](https://github.com/magma/magma/wiki/Contributing-Code-with-VSCode#using-devcontainer-for-development).


For a comprehensive developer environment supporting AGW c / c++ workflows see the [instructions below](#using-clang-tidy-in-vs-code).
With some effort this might be extensible to other Magma users.

## Prerequisites and Restrictions

DevContainer is a technology developed by Microsoft. Thus, it is only available for [_VS Code_](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), but **not** for _IntelliJ_. However, as Github is also currently owned by Microsoft, Github provides a DevContainer integration named ["Codespaces"](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces).
In order to use the Github codespaces, you must be member of the Magma Github organization.
In any case you will need a working Docker installation, as DevContainer is a docker based technology.

For detailed instructions see the [contributor documentation](https://github.com/magma/magma/wiki/Contributing-Code-with-VSCode#using-devcontainer-for-development).

## Developing DevContainer

The DevContainer is a docker image built from the docker file by convention situated at [`.devcontainer/Dockerfile`](Dockerfile).
The configuration how a DevContainer environment should be started can be found in the [`.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`](devcontainer.json).

Amongst others you have two options to start a DevContainer,
* either from a prebuilt docker image, e.g. pulled from a container registry with the following configuration node,
```json
	"image": "ghcr.io/magma/magma/devcontainer:latest",
```
  where you will need to have read access to the respective Docker registry, or
* you can build the docker image anew, when starting the container using the following configuration node instead,
```json
	"build": {
        "dockerfile": "Dockerfile",
        "context": "..",
    },
```
  which requires a connection to the internet to download the respective dependencies. It is important to note that the default context for the `build:` block in the `devcontainer.json` is the `.devcontainer` folder below the repository root. Hence, you must set the context next to the dockerfile to be able to resolve all dependency imports properly.

If you would want to build the dockerfile manually from the console, you would start the command `docker build -f .devcontainer/Dockerfile .` in the repository root.

## Using Clang-Tidy in VS Code

While we could commit / build a compilation database (compile_commands.json), at this time we are not doing so. Instead we will explicitly call out the Include paths for VS Code / Clang-Tidy as follows (open to ammending this if a clean mechanism of generating compile commands is found):

You should not have to ask for Clang-Tidy to run on the open file, it should do so automatically. But if not try `F1` and type `Clang-Tidy: Lint File`. You can monitor behavior by `View->Output` tab in VS code -> select `Clang-Tidy` from the Drop down menu top right.

For any header include that is undiscovered by Clang-Tidy (e.g. `error: 'bstrlib.h' file not found [clang-diagnostic-error]`):

**note! note to be confused with `cannot open source file` of type `C/C++` -> this indicates that Intellisense is missing includes, see [below](#Fixing-Intellisense) for how to fix.**

- Fix locally in docker and test
  - Update of `clang-tidy.compilerArgs` in your **container** settings.json file
    - Press `F1` and then search for `Preferences: Open Remote Settings (Dev Container)` Hit enter
    - Update the `clang-tidy.compilerArgs` with additional include directory paths
      - These may be in Magma codebase, or ...
      - environmental within docker (`find / -name <header_name.h> to discover`)
  - Update of settings.json for Dev Container should immediately take effect for Clang-Tidy
- Once tested locally, add to .devcontainer for future users
  - Open `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and update its `clang-tidy.compilerArgs`

### Fixing Intellisense

If you see `View->Problems` pane outputs of the shape `cannot open source file "bstrlib.h" C/C++`, this is an Intellisense warning.  We want to work on cleaning these up as well.

To address these, we want to modify the repo's `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file to add the additional Include paths.  Test the change in your Docker container, then upstream to the repo!

### Using Clang-Tidy broadly

To run it over the entire code base, it's advised to use [run-clang-tidy.py](https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra/blob/master/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py) provided by LLVM team. This handles concurrency of analysis and edits to the many files.

This tool wants a `compile_commands.json` list of compiler directives, which we can achieve by setting an environment variable for CMake: [`CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS.html).

```shell
cd lte/gateway
make build_oai
cd /build/c/
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/llvm-mirror/clang-tools-extra/master/clang-tidy/tool/run-clang-tidy.py
python run-clang-tidy.py -checks='-*,clang-analyzer-security*,android-*,cert-*,clang-analyzer-*,concurrency-*,misc-*,bugprone-*' 2>&1 | tee clang-tidy.findings | grep warning:
```

Note that we are only using clang-tidy fimndings that are possibly bugs / alarming (or at least htat is the intent) - and are diabling the readability / formatting / code structure best practices.  We should come back and look at what automatic fixes clang-tidy can apply in these domains.

Detailed outputs will be available in clang-tidy.findings.

For an explanation of all checks see [Clang-Tidy Documentation](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/checks/list.html).

Note that some builds are not generating build_commands.json - even with CMake flags set in CMakeFiles.txt. I have not yet found an explanation - but one solution is to manually build the projects like so:

```bash
cd lte/gateway/c/session_manager
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
vim CMakeCache.txt -> edit the CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS to set it ON
cmake --build .
```

### Converting Clang-Tidy Output to CI Friendly things
